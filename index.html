            <ul>
                <li>Focus and Purpose of the Test/Quiz - Provide students context by letting them know what content is being focused on for the quiz and the learning goals the quiz is measuring.</li>
                <li>Whether Students Can Expect Feedback - Including question feedback is recommended, as it helps students better learn from the test experience. This is especially important for practice quizzes. Let students know if they will be receiving feedback so they know what to expect.  </li>
                <li>Navigation Instructions - In an online environment, letting students know what to expect with the quiz navigation is important. Will all the questions be on one screen? Or, will they need to click "Next" to see the next question? What buttons do they click to start or submit a quiz?</li>
                <li>If the Test/Quiz is Timed - If a test or quiz is timed, emphasize this to students letting them know when the time starts and the importance of completing the test in one sitting.</li>
                <li>Weighting - If you weight your tests or quizzes in the course, let students know what that is and the impact this may have on their final grade.</li>
